## What is privacy and information privacy?

**Privacy** is seen as an individual condition of life characterized by exclusion from publicity.

Privacy as a concept is closely related to information. Privacy as expressed by means of information implies that there are different categories of privacy namely:
- Private communications
- Privacy of the body
- Personal information
- Information about one’s possessions – closely related to property right.

## How does the dissemination of information actually affect privacy?

**Information mediates relationships**
- Personal relationships are developed or nurtured on the basis of information about an individual.
- Different relationships are based on different kinds of information. Think of social media.
- Privacy is important because it allows you to maintain a diversity of relationships.

ICTs are especially involved in these kinds of relationship. Information determines how we are treated by organizations. A credit company will extend the amount of credit depending on the kind and amount of information it has on you. What this means is that usually it is a computer that makes a decision about you and your credibility.

## Kinds of privacy and the technology that affects it
- Physical/accessibility privacy
- Decisional Privacy
- Psychological/Mental Privacy
- Informational Privacy

## What do we need to keep private?
<details>
  <summary>What is considered personal information?</summary>
- Information relating to an identifiable, living, natural person, and where it is applicable, an identifiable, existing juristic person, including but not limited to:
- information relating to the race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, national, ethnic or social origin, color, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental health, well-being, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth of the person;
information relating to the education or the medical, financial, criminal or employment history or the person;
- any identifying number, symbol, email address, physical address, telephone number or other particular assignment to the person;
- the blood type or any other bio-metric information of the person;
</details>
- the personal opinions, views or preferences of the person;
- correspondence sent by the person that is implicitly or explicitly of a private or confidential nature or further correspondence that would reveal the contents of the original correspondence;
- the views or opinions of another individual about the person; and
- the name of the person if it appears with other personal information relating to the person if the disclosure of the name itself would reveal information about the person.

## Protection of Personal Information Act (No 4 of 2013)
<details>
  <summary>The purpose of the Protection of Personal Information Bill is to:</summary>
- give effect to the constitutional right to privacy, by safeguarding personal information when processed by a responsible party, subject to justifiable limitations that are aimed at:
* balancing the right to privacy against other rights, particularly the right of access to information;
* protecting important interests, including the free flow of information within the Republic and across international borders;
* regulate the manner in which personal information may be processed, by establishing principles, in harmony with international standards, that prescribe the minimum threshold requirements for lawful processing of personal information.
* provide persons with rights and remedies to protect their personal information from processing that is not in accordance with this Act; and
* establish voluntary and compulsory measures, including an Information Protection Regulator, to ensure respect for and to promote, enforce and fulfill the rights protected by this Act
</details>

#### Accountability
The entity that holds collected information must be in compliance with the bill.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
This principle assigns responsibility to the party or institution that holds personal information in terms of compliance with the protection of personal information as set out in the Bill. It will be difficult for an organization to ensure that the requirements of the Bill are properly embedded within its business. Therefore, an individual at a suitably high level should be given the task of managing the organisation’s responsibilities in terms of the Bill.
</details>

#### Processing Limitations
Collected information should be used only for its original intended purpose.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
This principle requires that personal information may only be collected directly from the data subject and processed in a fair and lawful manner. Fair processing implies that the processing must be done with consent of the individual, or where it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, public law duty or contractual obligation. In order to protect individual right to privacy (as stated in section 14 of the constitution), the amount of personal information gathered should never exceed the purpose for which it is needed.
</details>

#### Purpose Specification
Any collected information must be for a specific purpose and the individual should be aware of the information.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
Any personal information collected must be for a specific, lawful, explicitly defined and legitimate purpose. The data subject should be aware of what information is being processed, the purpose for which the information is collected, and who the likely recipients of the information will be.

The collectors of such information must establish mechanisms to ensure that personal information is only kept for as long as it is required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. When information is destroyed, it must be done in a manner that prevents any reconstruction in an intelligible form.
</details>

#### Further Processing Limitation
If collected information will be further processed it requires additional consent.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
Personal information may only be processed in a way that leads to the fulfillment of the purpose for which the information was collected initially. Further processing of information must only occur at the additional consent of the individual. Further processing of information without consent must be proven to be compatible with the original purpose.
</details>

#### Information Quality
Any collected information should be complete, not misleading, accurate and up to date.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
The person or institution responsible for determining the purpose and means for processing personal information should ensure that the information is complete, not misleading, up to date and accurate
</details>

#### Openness
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
This principle is linked directly to an organisation’s duty to process information in a fair and transparent manner. Personal information may only be collected following the notification of the Commission and at the knowledge of the data subject.
</details>

#### Security Safeguards
The entity who collected the information is responsible for safeguarding the information.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
The Bill requires the implementation of technical and organizational measures to secure the integrity of personal information, and to guard against the risk of loss, damage, interference, modification or destruction of personal information. Also, personal information should also be protected against any unauthorized or unlawful access or processing.

It is the organisation’s responsibility to:
- implement security measures to safeguard personal information held by the organization;
- respect personal information that is processed by third parties on behalf of the organization; and
- notify stakeholders if personal information has been compromised in any way.
</details>

#### Data Subject Participation
The subject is entitled to know the particulars of their information held by the entity.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
A data subject is entitled to the particulars of his or her personal information held by any institution or person, as well as to the identity of any person that had access to his or her personal information. The data subject is also entitled to request the correction or deletion of information held by another organization about them that may be inaccurate, outdated or misleading.
</details>

## Chapter 8: Personal Information and Privacy Protection
This Chapter establishes a voluntary regime for protection of personal information. Personal information includes any information capable of identifying an individual.
- Collectors of personal information (data collectors) may subscribe to a set of universally accepted data protection principles. It is envisaged that consumers will prefer to deal with only those data collectors that have subscribed to the recorded data protection principles.
- The sanction for breach of these provisions is left to the parties themselves to agree on.

## Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication Related Information (Act 70 of 2002)
### RICA
This law regulates the interception of communications, the monitoring of radio signals and radio frequency spectrum's and the provision of communication-related information (information relating to indirect communication in the records of telecommunication service providers). Written consent is required to monitor the use of third parties, contractors and employees accessing company premises and telecommunication systems, only if the company intercepts communication for investigation purposes.

It regulates law enforcement where interception of communications is involved and does not allow telecommunication services which do not have the capability to be intercepted. It requires telecommunication service providers store communication-related information (CRI) for a specified period of time in a secure location. Lastly it prohibits the manufacturing, assembling, possessing, selling, purchasing or advertising of interception equipment without a certificate of exemption issued by the relevant Minister (Wikipedia, 2011).

<details>
  <summary>Conflict with the Constitution</summary>
Section 14 of the Bill of Rights in the South African Constitution explicitly states that that "everyone has a right to privacy, which includes the right not to have (...) (d) the privacy of their communications infringed”
-  Provisions in RICA allow for that right to be infringed??
-  However, various other provisions in the Bill of Rights indirectly imply a right to safety and security (Chapter 11 of the constitution outlines the rights to safety).
- Parliament has therefore attempted to balance these two conflicting rights by providing for judicial oversight and approval of any interception of communication, limiting the interception only to those cases where an investigation is justified.
</details>

## Information accuracy
Accuracy refers to the authenticity and integrity of information. It is information of genuine detail, from undisputed origin or authorship. Accuracy is to ensure that the information is correct and without any mistake.

The quality of information measured by:
- accuracy,
- timeliness,
- completeness,
- relevance
- and if it is easy to understood by the users

So accuracy is important for quality of information.

## Discussion of Accuracy (Mason, 1986)
- Mason argued that when designing information systems, it is the designer's responsibility to be "vigilant in the pursuit of accuracy of information" because people might be harmed by inaccurate data.
- This is not the main threat of today - Now, inaccuracy includes issues when dealing with intentional falsification of information.

**Disinformation** is false or inaccurate information that is spread deliberately with intentions of turning genuine information useless. For this reason, it is synonymous with and sometimes called **black propaganda**.
<details>
  <summary>More</summary>
It is an act of deception and false statements to convince someone of untruth. Disinformation should not be confused with misinformation, information that is unintentionally false.

In politics, disinformation is the deliberate attempt to deflect voter support of an opponent, disseminating false statements of innuendo based on the candidates vulnerabilities as revealed by opposition research. In both cases, it also includes the distortion of true information in such a way as to render it useless.
</details>

## Propaganda
Information, ideas, or rumors deliberately spread widely to help or harm a person, group, movement, institution, nation, etc...
Types of propaganda:
- Bandwagon
- Plain Folks
- Glittering Generality
- Transfer
- Testimonial
- Repetition
- Name Calling

## Identity theft and fraud
**Identity theft** is when personal details of an individual are stolen and identity fraud is the use of those details to commit fraud.
- In the current technological environment, one of the biggest issues of intentional falsification of information is identity theft. Identity theft occurs when someone knowingly and intentionally steals your personal information.

<details>
  <summary>This can be done through</summary>
- physical theft of wallets containing identifying documents and bank cards;
- “dumpster diving”
- digitally intercepting personal information shared online through personal communications or online business transactions;
- “shoulder surfing”, where an identity thief stands close enough to you during a personal transaction that they can see the personal information you are completing. “Identity theft, also known as ID theft is a crime in which a criminal obtains key pieces of personal information, such as Social Security or driver's license numbers, in order to pose as someone else.”
</details>

## Types of identity theft
#### Criminal identity theft
- This is when a criminal identifies themselves as someone else, through the use of stolen credentials or a fake ID, during arrest.
- It becomes difficult for the victim of identity theft to clear themselves of a criminal record that may be as a result of criminal ID theft.

#### Financial identity theft
- This is considered the most common type of identity theft.
- This is when someone applies for loans, opens credit accounts, purchases goods and services in another individual’s name.

#### Identity cloning
- The identity thief impersonates someone else – could be an illegal immigrant or those hiding from authorities.

#### Medical identity theft
- This type of theft involves impersonating another person in order to obtain medical care, drugs or to commit medical insurance fraud. This may affect the victim through charges brought forward in the event of drug abuse, or negative effect on medical insurance in the future.

#### Child identity theft
- When the identity thief (be it a stranger, family member or friend) uses the child’s identity number to establish lines of credit or make fraudulent purchases.

#### Synthetic identity theft
- Identities are completely or partially fabricated. Fake ID documents, or combinations of identity numbers or names from a number of different people may be used to create an entirely fictional identity. This is difficult to track, and is most harmful to the credit organizations themselves, because of the confusion of details.

## Defining Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights is the term used for intangible (immaterial) property rights which are the results of intellectual effort

<details>
  <summary>Definition according to the World Intellectual Property Organization</summary>
“Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.”
</details>

## Role of Intellectual Property in modern society (Zuallcobley, 2006)
- Protect economic rights of creators
- Development and transfer of technology
- Cultural development
- Capital expenditure for new products
- Promote research and development

- Maintaining loyal followers
- Profit

## The dual nature principle (Ackerman & Britz, 2006)
Intellectual property has unique dual properties namely the right to own (control) as well as the right of access.
Intellectual property systems are developed to:
- Protect the moral rights of authors (moral justification);
- Recognize and protect the right of fair compensation for the creation and distribution of information products (economic justification).
- Enhance, to the benefit of the common good, the creation and accessibility of new knowledge (social justification).
