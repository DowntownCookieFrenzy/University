# Semester Test 1: Cheatsheet.
A markdown file containing important notes for GLY155 - Semester Test 1.
## Geology - Meaning:
* Geo - Earth
* logy - Knowledge
Thus Geology is latin for the study of the Earth.

## The Solar System:

* Mercury
* Venus
* Earth
* Mars
* Jupiter
* Saturn
* Uranus
* Neptune
* Pluto (Pluto is not conisdered a planet but rather a dwarf-planet)


## The Rock Cycle:

The Rock Cycle is a group of changes. Igneous rock can change into sedimentary rock or into metamorphic rock. Sedimentary rock can change into metamorphic rock or into igneous rock. Metamorphic rock can change into igneous or sedimentary rock.
Igneous rock forms when magma cools and makes crystals. Magma is a hot liquid made of melted minerals. The minerals can form crystals when they cool. Igneous rock can form underground, where the magma cools slowly. Or, igneous rock can form above ground, where the magma cools quickly.

## Elements In The Earth's Crust:
* Iron       Fe   35%
* Oxygen     O    30%
* Silicone   Si   15%
* Magnesium  Mg   13%
* Nickel     N    2.4%
* Sulfur     S    1.9%
* Calsium    Ca   1.1%
* Aluminium  Al   1.1%

## Plate Tetonics:
It is the movement of the plates and the forces that act on them that causes and can explain the
* Volcanic activity
* Mountains
* Seafloor structures
* Rock assemblages

Mantle convection is the movement of the Earth's solid silicate mantle caused by heat currents from the interior of the Earth ( radio-active decay etc )

## Formation Of The Earth:

### Continental Drift:
A Theory which suggests that all the continents where once one. This theory is supported by fossils of prehistoric animals being found on two different continents.

### Nebula Hypothesis:
The planets are byproducts of cosmic gas and dust clouds left over by the formation of a star.

## Boundaries:
### Divergent Boundaries
Occurs when two tetonic plates move away from one another.<br>

#### Types:
* Oceanic Plate Seperation
* Continental Plate Seperation

### Convergent Boundaries
Occurs when two tetonic plates move towards each other.<br>

#### Types:
* Ocean-ocean Convergence
* Ocean-continent Convergence
* Continent-continent Convergence

### Transform Fault Boundaries
A transform fault or transform boundary (also known as a conservative plate boundary, since these faults neither create nor destroy lithosphere), is a type of fault whose relative motion is predominantly horizontal, in either a sinistral (left lateral) or dextral (right lateral) direction.

#### Types:
* Mid-ocean Ridge Transform Fault
* Continental Transform Fault

## The Grand Reconstruction
* Assembly and breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia
* Assembly and breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea

Rodinia formed about 1.1 billion years ago and started to break up 750 million years ago.
Pangaea broke up about 195 million years ago.

The Earth looked much like it does today approximately 66 million years ago.

## Rock Types:
### Ingenous Rocks
Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, is one of the three main rock types. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.

There are four types namely:
* Felsic Igneous Rocks
* Mafic Igneous Rocks
* Ultramafic Igneous Rocks  
* Intermediate Igneous Rocks

### Sedimentary Rocks
Sedimentary rocks are types of rock that are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of that material at the Earth's surface and within bodies of water.
### Metamorphic Rocks
A metamorphic rock is a result of a transformation of a pre-existing rock. The original rock is subjected to very high heat and pressure, which cause obvious physical and/or chemical changes.
