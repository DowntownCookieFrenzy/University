## Functional Dependence Concepts
Definition:
The attribute B is fully functionally dependent on the attribute A if each value of A determines one and only one value of B

## Dependency diagram
- Depicts all dependencies found within given table structure
- Helpful in getting bird’s-eye view of all relationships among table’s attributes
- Makes it less likely that you will overlook an important dependency
