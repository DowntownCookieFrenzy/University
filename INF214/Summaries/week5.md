# Week 5

## The Extended Entity Relationship Model:

In this model we have two entity types;
* Entity supertype: A generic entity with common characteristics which relate to one or more entity subtypes.
* Enttity subtype: Contains unique characteristics of each entity subtype.

## Specialisation Hierarchy:
This hierarchy shows the arrangement of higher/supertype entities compared to lower/subtype entities.
NB Subtype entities only exist in scope of supertypes and every subtype has only one supertype to which it is related.
