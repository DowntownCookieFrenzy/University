# Week 1

# The Database and the DBMS
- Database: shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of data
    - End-user data: raw facts of interest to the end user
    - DBMS integrates many usersâ€™ views of the data

- Metadata provides description of data characteristics and relationships in data
    - Complements and expands value of data

Database management system (DBMS): collection of programs Manage structure and control access to data

# Advantages of the DBMS

- Improved data security
- Better data integration
- Minimized data inconsistency
- Improved data access
- Improved decision making
- Increased end-user productivity

# Data Modeling and Data Models
#### Data models
- Relatively simple representations of complex real-world data structures
- Often graphical
#### Model: 
- an abstraction of a real-world object or event
- Useful in understanding complexities of the real-world environment
