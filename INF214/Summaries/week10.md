## Relationships

     - Nonspecific relationship; Many instances of an entity are related to many instances of another entity. (M:M relationship) Resolved by adding an associative entity.


## What Is A Good Data Model

     - Simple; Attributes that describe any given entity should descript only that entity. Each attribute of an entity instance can have only one value.
     - Non-Redundant; Each data attribute other than foreign keys, describe at most one entity.
     - Flexible And Adaptable; Grows as required. Can accept variations of data record. Refers to the capacity of records to increase in number.


## Data Analysis

A technique used to improve a data model for implementation as a database. Again the goal is a simple, Non-Redundant, flexible and Adaptable database.


## Normalization

A technique used by data analysts which organises data into groups of Non-Redundant, stable ,flexible and adaptive entities.
