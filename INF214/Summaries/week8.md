# Week 8

The information system is composed of people, hardware, software, databases, applications and procedures.

## Systems Analysis

A process that establishes need for an extent of information system.

## Systems Development

A process of creating an information system.


## Applications

- Transform data into information that forms basis for decision making.
- Normally they produce a formal report, tabulations or a graphical display.

Applications are composed of data and code.

## Performance

Depends on three factors
- Database design and implementation.
- Application design and implementation.
- Administrative procedures


## Database Development

A process of design and implementation.
Implementation includes:

- Creating database storage structure.
- Loading data into the database.
- Providing for data management.

## The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- Trace history of information system.
- Db design and application Development mapped out and evaluated.

Dividided into five phases namely;
- Planning
- Analysis
- Detailed systems design
- Implementation
- Maintenance

It is an iterative rather than a sequential process.
