# Data Redundancy:
Redundancy although sometimes required in a database leads to less efficiency. It is important to note that 
foreign keys can be used to manage the redundancy.


# E(ntity) R(elationship) D(iagram):
An ERD has three major components namely entities , relationships and attributes.

## Entities:
* Refers to entity sets.
* Corresponds to a table in relational databases.
* Crows foot notation uses a rectangle to represent entities.
* Entity name is usually a noun written in capital letters.

* Composite identifier
* Single-Valued ( may not belong here )
